## RainGull Project Log (Updated April 16, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Accomplishments:

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Created Django project `raingull`.
   - Setup applications: `core` (main app), `email_plugin` (handles IMAP/SMTP).
   - Defined models (`Plugin`, `ServiceInstance`) with JSON-based dynamic configurations.

2. **Plugin Infrastructure**
   - Established a plugin registration system.
   - Implemented manifest structure (`manifest.json`) for plugins.
   - Tested manifest file parsing and dynamic configuration handling successfully.

3. **Dynamic Form Handling**
   - Successfully generated dynamic Django forms from plugin manifest files.
   - Resolved issues with dynamic fields not displaying in the Django admin by shifting to custom views/templates.
   - Confirmed dynamic form fields render correctly and data is stored as intended.

4. **Custom Admin Management**
   - Developed routes (`urls.py`) and views (`views.py`) for managing service instances outside of Django's built-in admin.
   - Created and tested custom templates:
     - `templates/core/service_instance_list.html`
     - `templates/core/manage_service_instance.html`

5. **IMAP Plugin Implementation**
   - Successfully implemented full CRUD operations for IMAP service instances:
     - Create: Dynamic tables created based on plugin manifest
     - Read: Configuration fields properly displayed and loaded
     - Update: Changes saved correctly to database
     - Delete: Service instance and associated tables properly removed
   - Added "Test Connection" functionality that works in both create and manage views
   - Implemented robust table creation and deletion for dynamic models
   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging

6. **SMTP Plugin Implementation**
   - Successfully implemented full CRUD operations for SMTP service instances
   - Added "Test Connection" functionality matching IMAP plugin behavior
   - Implemented outgoing message schema for email sending
   - Added proper error handling for SMTP operations
   - Verified dynamic table creation and deletion
   - Confirmed proper handling of different encryption types (None, STARTTLS, SSL/TLS)

7. **Message Standardization**
   - Implemented `RaingullStandardMessage` model for unified message format
   - Added `raingull_id` field to track messages across different services
   - Implemented message translation from IMAP to standard format
   - Added snippet generation (first 200 characters) for message previews
   - Verified proper copying of message IDs across tables
   - Tested successful translation of multiple messages

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Known Issues:

- None - Both IMAP and SMTP plugins are fully operational

### üöß Next Immediate Steps:

- Implement message sending functionality using the SMTP plugin
- Add user management with email addresses for SMTP plugin
- Create a unified interface for managing both incoming and outgoing messages
- Add comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms for message processing

### üöÄ Git Push Workflow:

```bash
cd ~/dev/raingull
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Implemented message standardization with raingull_id tracking and snippet generation"
git push origin main
```
