## RainGull Project Log (Updated April 14, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Accomplishments:

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Created Django project `raingull`.
   - Setup applications: `core` (main app), `email_plugin` (handles IMAP/SMTP).
   - Defined models (`Plugin`, `ServiceInstance`) with JSON-based dynamic configurations.

2. **Plugin Infrastructure**
   - Established a plugin registration system.
   - Implemented manifest structure (`manifest.json`) for plugins.
   - Tested manifest file parsing and dynamic configuration handling successfully.

3. **Dynamic Form Handling**
   - Successfully generated dynamic Django forms from plugin manifest files.
   - Resolved issues with dynamic fields not displaying in the Django admin by shifting to custom views/templates.
   - Confirmed dynamic form fields render correctly and data is stored as intended.

4. **Custom Admin Management**
   - Developed routes (`urls.py`) and views (`views.py`) for managing service instances outside of Django's built-in admin.
   - Created and tested custom templates:
     - `templates/core/service_instance_list.html`
     - `templates/core/manage_service_instance.html`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Known Issues:

- Django admin limitations with dynamically added fields necessitated creating custom views/templates.
- IMAP "Test Server Connection" functionality not yet implemented.

### üöß Next Immediate Steps:

- Implement IMAP "Test Server Connection" feature.
- Enhance error logging and exception handling for IMAP/SMTP.
- Begin SMTP (outgoing) email handling functionality.
- Refine plugin management UI.

### üöÄ Git Push Workflow:

```bash
cd ~/dev/raingull
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Completed initial custom views and dynamic fields handling"
git push origin main
```
