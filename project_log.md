# RainGull Project Log

## Environment Setup

### Date: [Today's Date]

**Accomplished:**
- Created the project directory (`~/dev/raingull`).
- Set up Python virtual environment (`.venv`).
- Installed Django 5.2.
- Resolved filesystem permission errors caused by mistakenly running commands with elevated permissions.
- Initialized Django project (`raingull`) successfully.
- Created initial Django apps:
  - `core` (for user management, plugin management, logging, message queues).
  - `email_plugin` within the `plugins` directory (for IMAP & SMTP email handling).
- Opened the project successfully in VS Code.
- Initialized a new Git repository and pushed to GitHub under `still-crazy-productions/raingull`.
- Defined and implemented initial core data models (`UserProfile`, `Plugin`, `Message`).
- Integrated the RainGull Standard Message Format (RSMF) model (`RainGullStandardMessage`).
- Established the `ServiceInstance` model to manage dynamic plugin configurations.
- Created and successfully loaded a sample `manifest.json` for the email plugin.
- Verified proper registration and functionality of all core models in Django admin.

## Next Steps
- Develop and refine the plugin interface mechanism.
- Begin implementing core functionality for IMAP/SMTP email handling in `email_plugin`.
- Explore and plan further plugin manager functionalities (activation, deactivation, management).

## Notes
- Avoid using global Python/Django installations (`sudo`, `pipx`) within virtual environments.
- Always activate your virtual environment before running Django-related commands.
- Document issues and their resolutions clearly in this log for future reference.
- Keep the Git repository regularly updated with meaningful commits.
